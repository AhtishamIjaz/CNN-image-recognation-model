# CNN-image-recognation-model
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)–based image recognition model designed to classify images using deep learning. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a labeled dataset .

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the workflow of developing an image classifier—data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and predictions.
